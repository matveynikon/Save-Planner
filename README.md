# Save Planner. A simple tool to plan your savings.

## The idea
When I hear people say "I need to save X$ in Y months for Z", I always start calculating how much they need to save every month and how much they're going to have to compromise their other expenses. This is because I think that when people plan on saving, they should know how much they need to save every month and if their saving goals are reasonable and won't compromise their other expenses and goals too much. This is why I've built **Save Planner**, a simple tool to calculate how much you need to save every month for different goals(vacation, house, e.t.c.).

## How it works
**Here's how it works.**
1. You enter how much you need to save in approximately how many months for different goals(You can submit 1-4 goals)
2. The app shows you how much you need to save for each goal and also visualizes how much you need to save for each goal compared to your other expenses through a sankey diagram.

### Here's a demo:

**You can try the app yourself at: https://saveplanner.netlify.app/**

## Development
The app is built on:
1. HTML
2. CSS
3. Pure Javascript

I've also used [Plotly](https://plotly.com/graphing-libraries/) for the sankey diagram.
It is also possible to download you saving plan's sankey diagram as a `.png` file through Plotly.
